# Cyber Security Internship - Task 1
🔍 Day 1 – Exploring Nmap and Nessus (Port Scanning)
Author: Aashutosh Rana
Date: 22-09-2025

✨ Introduction
This repository marks the beginning of my hands-on journey into network reconnaissance, focusing on port scanning with both Nmap and Nessus tools. The project covers discovering open ports, analyzing running services, and interpreting scan results effectively—critical skills for cybersecurity practitioners.

⚙️ Tools & Methods
Nmap – for versatile network discovery and security auditing

Nessus – for advanced vulnerability scanning with configurable port scans

Command-Line Interface – for running scan commands

Markdown – for documentation and analysis delivery

🚩 Key Takeaways
Gained practical experience with both basic and advanced scanning techniques using Nmap

Leveraged Nessus to perform comprehensive port scanning and vulnerability assessment

Generated and interpreted multiple output file types from the scans

Compiled findings into a clear, organized analysis report

Created a well-structured, shareable GitHub repository for reference and learning

🔮 Road Ahead
This is the foundational Day 1 of my network security exploration. Future work will delve into more advanced scanning methods, service enumeration, and vulnerability analysis to enhance practical cybersecurity skills and knowledge.

If desired, this can be further tailored for a technical audience or beginner learners.
